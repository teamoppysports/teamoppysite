## Get Started

To get started open [Tagger](https://tagger.teamoppy.com) in your browser.

### Create a New Game

In the Tagger page click on the Game menu option and click New.

<br/>

#### Enter Game Details

- Specify the team names and colors (you can specify a main color and a color for text). 

- Specify the Sport. If your sport does not exist then you can create your own sport by clicking on the "+" button beside the sport dropdown.

- Optionally specify the Competition, Date and Venue.

- If you want to do video tagging then specify a video source. You can choose from using a Local file that is on your device or a YouTube or Vimeo url.

- Edit your team lists with the player details (number, name, short name and position).

- Then click save.

<br/>

### Set Tagger Preferences

From the left navigation menu, select Preferences. In here you specify how you would like the Tagger page to display the player and event buttons.

- Set the Events view to either Tabs or Full. With "Tabs" only one teams set of events will be displayed at a time. This may be preferable on mobile devices or if you are only concerned with tagging your own teams events. With "Full", both teams events are displayed. This is preferable on larger devices (laptops, tablets) and when you are tagging events for both teams.

- Set the Event button display to show either the name of the event, the short name of the event or the event icon. Short names and icons may be preferable for mobile devices. 

- Set the Player button display to show full name or short name. Short name may be preferable on mobile devices.

- Set the Player button badge display. This is the little blue badge that is displayed on the player button. This can be set to display the player number or the player position, whichever is preferable.
