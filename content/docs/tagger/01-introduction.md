# What is Tagger?

Tagger is an Event Tagging application with a built in Dashboard. It can be used for live game tagging or for post game video tagging. Tagger accelerates the event tagging and analysis process.

You can be up and running within seconds of launching the application. Just create a New Game, fill in your team details, choose your sport (or create your own one), start the timer and begin tagging.

## Tagging Engine

The tagging engine allows you to tag by player or by team. Simply click on the player button or the team tag button to open the event window. Click on the event along with the event labels. Select the event positions and/or outcome positions where applicable to gather x,y data. The event is captured and added to the events table. The Dashboard will be automatically updated.

## Live or Video Tagging

Tagger can be used for live game tagging (i.e. no video) or post game video tagging. For video tagging simply add your video source in the game details (YouTube url, Vimeo url or Local File), use the video controls to go to the start of the game, pause the video and set your Timer to be in sync with the video. The timer will then tick along with the video and pause with the video etc...

When events are tagged, then the video time of the event will also be tracked allowing you to view a clip of each event that is tagged in the Event Viewer. You can open the event viewer from various places - in the events table, position maps, etc...

## Dashboard

Tagger has a built in Dashboard which is customisable and displays a number of items which give a 360 degree view of the game:
- Summary totals including the score.
- Timeline, Bar, Pie and Donut Charts.
- Position Maps showing x, y positions for events.
- Insights into passages of play focusing on outcomes.

## Player Tables

You can get more granular into the the data by viewing the Player Tables to see totals per individual player. This is customisable - you can add new columns to existing tables or create brand new tables.

## Customise

Pretty much everything in Tagger is customisable. Go to the Configuration page to configure everything including:
- General details such as number of players per team, number of minutes per half
- Playing Area Graphics
- Playing Area Zones
- Events
- Scores
- Totals
- Timeline Graphs
- Charts
- Position Maps
- Player Tables
- Passages of play

## Share

Tagger generates a JSON (data) file with game and configuration data. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.
