## Integrating Tagger Data into Third-Party Software

In this document, we will outline the steps that you can follow to integrate tagger data into third-party software.

## Synchronizing Tagged Events with Video
The first step in integrating tagger data into third-party software is to ensure that the tagged events are synchronized with the video. This is important because it allows you to easily locate specific events in the video.

To synchronize the tagged events with the video, you can follow the steps here - [Synchronize Video](/docs/tagger/15-synchronize-video)

## Downloading XML from the Game Menu
The next step is to download the XML file from the game menu. This file contains the tagged event data that you want to import into the third-party software.

To download the XML file, follow these steps:
- in the Game menu, select Download XML
- in the pop-up dialog, select either Video Time (recommended) or Game Time and click the Download button 

Note: if the video is not synched then the XML will automatically be downloaded using the Game Time.

## Conclusion
Integrating tagger data into third-party software may sound tricky, but by following these steps, you can easily accomplish this task. Remember to synchronize the tagged events with the video before importing the XML file to ensure that the events are accurately located in the video. With these steps, you can integrate tagger data into third-party software and take advantage of the data to improve your analysis capabilities.
