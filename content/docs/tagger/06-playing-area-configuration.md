Switch this on if you would like to display team end indicators. This is helpful to indicate for example the teams goals at either end of the pitch.

### Rotate in mobile device portrait mode

Playing graphics will by default display as per how they are configured. Select this to rotate the graphic when in portrait mode on a mobile device. This would be commonly used for pitch or court graphics. For goal post graphics it is likely you would leave this unselected.
