## Introduction

Manager Mode is the latest feature introduced to Tagger. This was developed in collaboration with expert coaches, managers and analysts from the world of Hockey (relevant for many other sports also). The purpose of this feature is to support Coaches and Managers in particular during live games to manage rolling substitutions and on-field positional switches, monitor cards and countdowns, track players game time, throw alerts when specialist type players like a Flicker or Trapper are not on the field of play, change formations during the game and to display Quick Totals (basic counts of things like Shots and Penalty Corners).

The Manager Mode feature was designed and optimised in particular for Tablet and larger devices (Standard mode is available for mobile devices).

## Enable Manager Mode

Manager Mode can be enabled in the Application Preferences page. Select Live Manager Mode from the Tagger View options. This will default a number of other preferences further down e.g. the Live Manager Mode Display Options will default to Team Formation Portrait View and so forth.

</p>

The Live Manager Mode Default Player Event dropdown will be set to "Substitute/Switch". What this means is that when a user clicks on a player button (from the list or the team formation) then that will trigger the substitute/switch event.

</p>

Other options like the Player Buttons and Event Buttons will also be set. 

All of these options can be changed to suit the user and their specific device.


## Manager Mode Sport Configuration

As part of the collaboration we developed a specific "Hockey - Manager Mode" sport configuration - this is a smaller subset of the standard "Hockey" configuration. When users are creating a new game and want to use the Manager Mode, they should choose this sport configuration instead of the standard "Hockey" configuration.


## Features

The core features of Manager Mode include the following:

- Rolling substitutions and on-field Switches
- Cards and countdowns
- Track players game time 
- Throw alerts when specialist type players are not on the field of play 
- Modify the team formation before and during the game
- Display Quick Totals


### Substitutions and Switches

Substitutions and Switches can be performed very quickly by having the Default Player Event set to "Substitute/Switch" as mentioned above. This allows subsitutions and switches to be tracked seamlessly with two clicks (in the case of substitutions, the first click is the player coming off and the second click is the player coming on). In sports with rolling substitutions like Hockey then this becomes an important component on match day.

### Cards and Countdowns

To assign a card to a player, click on the card button, then select the card color button.

</p>

Then select the player to assign the card to:

</p>

The card is now assigned to the player and also appears in the Quick Totals section under the team. The card countdown begins. (Note: the card countdown is displayed in minutes and is refreshed every 5 secs by default).

</p>

### Track players game time

The players game time is linked to the main Timer so will pause and restart along with the Timer. It shows the players current shift time (or offshift time if one of the subs) and the total playing time for the player. This is a crucial component in aiding managers and coaches in their decision making when making substitutions.

The players game time is refreshed every 5 secs by default.

</p>

### Specialist Role Alerts

In Hockey like many other sports there are players on the team who have "Specialist" skills/roles. In Hockey, examples of these skills/roles could be the Flicker, Trapper and Injector roles. When a substitution happens, the app will notify the manager/coach via an alert if there are no players on the field with the specialist roles.

Specialist roles can be defined in the Configuration. And the roles can be assigned to players in the Game Details.

</p>

### Team Formation

The team formation component is useful to visualise the teams current formation and the player positions. The team formation can be modified at any time before or during the game to reflect the managers/coaches changes.

To modify the team formation, click on the Edit button. Then drag the players into their new formation - then hit save, optionally enter a description of the formation change.

### Quick Totals

The quick totals section displays a summary of some of the key events that a manager or coach may want to track such as Shots or Penalty Corners.

## Conclusion

Manager Mode is the result of weeks of collaboration with coaches, managers and analysts to come up with an optimised tagging view for assisting with live game management from a manager/coach perspective. Hockey was the main sport that this collaboration was focused on, however it can be used and could prove useful across any number of sports.

Thank you to all who participated in this collaboration (particularly Jimmy Culnane of Wimbledon and England Hockey) to bring this feature to fruition!
