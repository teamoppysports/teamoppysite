## Performance Analysis

Performance Analysis is an essential component in modern day team and individual sports. It is the function of analysing the performance of a team and individual players and providing insights to players and coaches. Feedback can be provided in real-time or post-game. It can take the form of detailed reports, statistical data, visual graphics, video clips and more. Analysis can be used to record and monitor the progress of a player or team as well as the opposition team. 

## TeamOppy Sports

TeamOppy Sports provides software applications to assist the Performance Analysis process. The latest apps [Tagger](https://tagger.teamoppy.com) and [Clipper](https://clipper.teamoppy.com) are both Progressive Web Applications. This means that they can be accessed from a modern browser(e.g. Chrome) but also can be installed on your device and can run in offline mode (not connected to the internet). These are compatible with most devices.

### Tagger

Tagger is an event tagging application that allows analysts to tag events that occur in a game (e.g. Shot from play, Possession, etc...). Tagger can be used for tagging during live games and also for post-game video tagging. It comes with a built-in Dashboard which provides real-time summary data, charts, position maps and insights.
