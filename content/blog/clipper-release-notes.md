This release contains the following changes:
- Video Export Functionality

### Video Export Functionality

This functionality allows users to export playlists and clips as video files ([webm](https://www.webmproject.org/users/)) when using local video files as the source. Note - this functionality is not applicable when using YouTube or Vimeo links.

To share the webm files users can simply upload to Google Drive and share a link with their audience - webm files can play directly from Google Drive. Note - it may take several minutes for Google Drive to process the video file and make it available to view after upload.

#### Twitter and WhatsApp
Webm files are not playable directly from apps like WhatsApp or cannot be uploaded to Twitter but the webm files can be easily converted to mp4 files if you need to share on those apps using something like https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-mp4 or other online tools.
