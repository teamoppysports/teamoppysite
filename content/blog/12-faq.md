## Why doesn't Manager Mode work when my tablet is in Portrait mode?

The Manager Mode layout has been optimised specifically for use with tablets in landscape mode. When the tablet is in Portrait mode then the layout defaults to the Standard Tagger layout. It can be confusing during a game if the layout automatically changes due to a tablet rotation so it is recommended to lock your screen in Landscape mode while using Tagger. Instructions for iPad and Samsung tablets below. Check your specific device documentation for instructions.

## I am in Manager Mode but clicking on players is not triggering substitution. What is happening?

Check the Preferences page. The Live Manager Mode - Default Player Event needs to be set to Substitute/Switch for substitution to automatically be triggered when clicking on a player.

<!-- ## In Manager Mode I see 2 times displayed in the Timer. What is the 2nd time?

The main larger timer pauses and plays when the pause/play button is pressed. The second smaller timer is a continuous time that only stops when you end a period or end the game. The continuous time is what is used when synching up video with your live game data post game. -->

## How do I save a game?

From the Game dropdown menu in Tagger, select the Download option. This downloads the game to your local device where you can then store in your own file system.

Please note that the Download XML option is for when you want to use the game in any other analysis platform that is compatible with the XML format.

## I created a Team on my laptop but I don't see it on my tablet?

## The buttons on my Tagger screen are too large or too small. How do I adjust them?

There are a number of options that you can select on the Preferences page to adjust the layout and the button sizes as well as change to using Short names or Icons. There are many different devices out there so playing around with these options are the best way to get the best view on your device.

## What is the best way of sharing the game with others?

There are a couple of options for Sharing the game - these are outlined on the Share page in the Tagger app. You can either download the file and send by email or otherwise to other people.
