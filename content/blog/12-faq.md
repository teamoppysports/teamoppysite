## Why doesn't Manager Mode work when my tablet is in Portrait mode?

The Manager Mode layout has been optimised specifically for use with tablets in landscape mode. When the tablet is in Portrait mode then the layout defaults to the Standard Tagger layout. It can be confusing during a game if the layout automatically changes due to a tablet rotation so it is recommended to lock your screen in Landscape mode while using Tagger. Instructions for iPad and Samsung tablets below. Check your specific device documentation for instructions.

## How do I save a game?

From the Game dropdown menu in Tagger, select the Download option. This downloads the game to your local device where you can then store in your own file system.

Please note that the Download XML option is for when you want to use the game in any other analysis platform that is compatible with the XML format.

## How do I re-open a saved game?

From the Game dropdown menu in Tagger, select the Import option. Choose your game file from your local file system and Import.

## I created a Team on my laptop but I don't see it on my tablet?

Data is local to the device that it is on. You can download your Team and send it to yourself via email and import it into your other devices.

This also applies to all other data objects such as Games and Sport Configurations.

## The buttons on my Tagger screen are too large or too small. How do I adjust them?

There are a number of options that you can select on the Preferences page to adjust the layout and the button sizes as well as change to using Short names or Icons. There are many different devices out there so playing around with these options are the best way to get the best view on your device.

## What is the best way of sharing the game with others?

There are a couple of options for Sharing the game - these are outlined on the Share page in the Tagger app. You can either download the file and send by email or otherwise to other people. Or you can upload to Google Drive and create a direct Tagger link using the Google Drive shared link. The direct Tagger link is a popular way of sharing data.
