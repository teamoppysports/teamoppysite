## What is it?

Tagger is an Event Tagging and Analysis application with a built in Dashboard. It can be used for live game tagging or for post game video tagging. Tagger accelerates the event tagging and analysis process.

You can be up and running within seconds of launching the application. Just create a New Game, fill in your team details, choose your sport (or create your own one), start the timer and begin tagging. For full functionality Sign Up for an account.

## Tagging Engine

The tagging engine allows you to tag by player or by team. Simply click on the player button or the team event button to open the event window. Click on the event along with the event labels if applicable. Select the event positions and/or outcome positions where applicable to gather x,y data. The event is captured and added to the event table. The Dashboard will be automatically updated.

## Live or Video Tagging

Tagger can be used for live game tagging (i.e. no video) or post game video tagging. For video tagging simply add your video source in the game details (YouTube url, Vimeo url or Local File), use the video controls to go to the start of the game, pause the video and set your Timer to be in sync with the video. The timer will then tick along with the video and pause with the video etc...

When events are tagged, then the video time of the event will also be tracked allowing you to view a clip of each event that is tagged in the Event Viewer. You can open the event viewer from various places - in the events table, position maps, etc...

## Dashboard

Tagger has a built in Dashboard which is customisable and displays a number of items which give a picture of the game:
- Summary totals including the score.
- Timeline, Bar, Pie and Donut Charts.
- Position Maps showing x, y positions for events.
- Insights into passages of play focusing on outcomes.

## Player Tables

You can get more granular into the the data by viewing the Player Tables to see totals per individual player. This is customisable - you can add new columns to existing tables or create brand new tables.

## Customise

Pretty much everything in Tagger is customisable. Go to the Configuration page to configure everything including:
- General details such as number of players per team, number of minutes per half
- Playing Area Graphics
- Playing Area Zones
- Events
- Scores
- Totals
- Timeline Graphs
- Charts
- Position Maps
- Player Tables
- Passages of play

## Share

Tagger generates a JSON (data) file with game and configuration data. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.

### Example


[Kilkenny versus Limerick - 2022 All-Ireland Hurling Final](https://tagger.teamoppy.com/?game=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1evoA6USB3yfmxu6X4lqBPoA6pB2zx3gJ%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing) is a simple example of tagging Shots, Puckouts and Possessions.


## Progressive Web Application

A progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform with a standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices.

### Installable

Tagger is installable which means it can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It's launchable from the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.

### Offline mode

Tagger can run in offline mode (i.e. no internet connection) or online mode.

## Thanks

A word of thanks to all the volunteers who helped to test Tagger, providing very positive feedback and also making some really good suggestions for new features which will be worked on in the coming months.
