## What is Clipper?

Video is a very powerful tool for providing feedback to players and coaches. Clipper assists in that process by highlighting specific things at various points in the video. 

Clipper is a simple video clipping tool that allows analysts to take clips from videos, add graphics and text to the clip, and add that clip to a playlist.

## Enhancing the clip

Clipper has a number of graphics that can be added to the video overlay, e.g ellipses, arrows, area highlighting, freehand drawing, and more. 

These objects can be customised to change color, stroke width, opacity and more. 

You can also add text to the screen to explain or emphasise a point.

## Share

Clipper generates a JSON (data) playlist file with details of the clips, the objects drawn on them, the text, etc. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.

### Example

[Italy versus Wales - 2022 Six Nations Rugby](https://clipper.teamoppy.com/?playlist=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1aCw8qGIasYhnDeWvm8k5-0sNZnN1IFaw%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing) 

## Progressive Web Application

A progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform with a standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices.

### Installable

Clipper is installable which means it can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It's launchable from the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.

### Offline mode

Clipper can run in offline mode (i.e. no internet connection) if using a local video file but needs to be online (connected to the internet) to be able to use YouTube or Vimeo video sources.
