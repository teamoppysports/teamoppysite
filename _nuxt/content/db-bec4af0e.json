It can be used for live game tagging or for post game video tagging. Tagger accelerates the event tagging and analysis process.\n\nYou can be up and running within seconds of launching the application. Just create a New Game, fill in your team details, choose your sport (or create your own one), start the timer and begin tagging. For full functionality Sign Up for an account.\n\n## Tagging Engine\n\nThe tagging engine allows you to tag by player or by team. Simply click on the player button or the team event button to open the event window. Click on the event along with the event labels if applicable. Select the event positions and/or outcome positions where applicable to gather x,y data. The event is captured and added to the event table. The Dashboard will be automatically updated.\n\n## Live or Video Tagging\n\nTagger can be used for live game tagging (i.e. no video) or post game video tagging. For video tagging simply add your video source in the game details (YouTube url, Vimeo url or Local File), use the video controls to go to the start of the game, pause the video and set your Timer to be in sync with the video. The timer will then tick along with the video and pause with the video etc...\n\nWhen events are tagged, then the video time of the event will also be tracked allowing you to view a clip of each event that is tagged in the Event Viewer. You can open the event viewer from various places - in the events table, position maps, etc...\n\n## Dashboard\n\nTagger has a built in Dashboard which is customisable and displays a number of items which give a picture of the game:\n- Summary totals including the score.\n- Timeline, Bar, Pie and Donut Charts.\n- Position Maps showing x, y positions for events.\n- Insights into passages of play focusing on outcomes.\n\n## Player Tables\n\nYou can get more granular into the the data by viewing the Player Tables to see totals per individual player. This is customisable - you can add new columns to existing tables or create brand new tables.\n\n## Customise\n\nPretty much everything in Tagger is customisable. Go to the Configuration page to configure everything including:\n- General details such as number of players per team, number of minutes per half\n- Playing Area Graphics\n- Playing Area Zones\n- Events\n- Scores\n- Totals\n- Timeline Graphs\n- Charts\n- Position Maps\n- Player Tables\n- Passages of play\n\n## Share\n\nTagger generates a JSON (data) file with game and configuration data. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.\n\n### Example\n\n\n[Kilkenny versus Limerick - 2022 All-Ireland Hurling Final](https://tagger.teamoppy.com/?game=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1-B5wTWIoMfON1j0jHLmf0tL2PJMT24Bj%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dshare_link) is a simple example of tagging Shots, Puckouts and Possessions.\n\n\n## Progressive Web Application\n\nA progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly.

Clipper assists in that process by highlighting specific things at various points in the video. \n\nClipper is a simple video clipping tool that allows analysts to take clips from videos, add graphics and text to the clip, and add that clip to a playlist.\n\n## Enhancing the clip\n\nClipper has a number of graphics that can be added to the video overlay, e.g ellipses, arrows, area highlighting, freehand drawing, and more. \n\nThese objects can be customised to change color, stroke width, opacity and more. \n\nYou can also add text to the screen to explain or emphasise a point.\n\n## Share\n\nClipper generates a JSON (data) playlist file with details of the clips, the objects drawn on them, the text, etc. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.\n\n### Example\n\n[Italy versus Wales - 2022 Six Nations Rugby](https://clipper.teamoppy.com/?playlist=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1aCw8qGIasYhnDeWvm8k5-0sNZnN1IFaw%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing) \n\n## Progressive Web Application\n\nA progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform with a standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices.\n\n### Installable\n\nClipper is installable which means it can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It's launchable from the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.\n\n### Offline mode\n\nClipper can run in offline mode (i.e. no internet connection) if using a local video file but needs to be online (connected to the internet) to be able to use YouTube or Vimeo video sources.\n\n## Get Started\n\nClick here to get started - [Clipper](https://clipper.teamoppy.com)","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/03-clipper","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1681040947215},"$loki":3},{"slug":"05-clipper-release-notes","description":"This is the main release note blog that describes changes that are made in the Clipper application.","title":"Clipper Release Notes","image":"/images/blog/clipper-release-notes/clipper_release_notes.png","publishedAt":"2022-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"name":"Teamoppy Sports","link":"https://twitter.com/teamoppy"},"tags":["Video","Graphics","Clips","Playlists"],"toc":[{"id":"nov-08-2022","depth":2,"text":"Nov 08, 2022"},{"id":"default-properties-section","depth":3,"text":"Default Properties section"},{"id":"maximised-video-in-the-player-on-mobile-devices","depth":3,"text":"Maximised video in the Player on mobile devices"},{"id":"nov-02-2022","depth":2,"text":"Nov 02, 2022"},{"id":"video-export-functionality","depth":3,"text":"Video Export Functionality"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"nov-08-2022"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#nov-08-2022","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Nov 08, 2022"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This release contains the following changes:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Default Properties section"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Maximised video in the Player on mobile devices"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"default-properties-section"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#default-properties-section","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Default Properties section"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In the Editor view, when clicking on the drawing objects (e.g. ellipse, arrow, etc...) the objects default properties will be displayed and can be modified up front prior to adding the object to the video layer.

This provides better performance, stability and lays the foundation for future innovations.\n\n### Enhanced Guided Tagger Flow\n\nThe tagging engine is much zippier now thanks to the latest technology and a restructuring of the code. The process is now also much smoother with a new pop-out window which aligns to the right hand side of the screen. This means that for video tagging you have full view of the video at all times when tagging (using Video Analysis mode). The app also guides you through the available options to select based on the Event Configuration in a more intuitive way.\n\n### New Install Button\n\nThere is a new install button on the main welcome page. On Windows and Android devices this will trigger the installation process. On iOS devices you will be directed to the manual instructions for installing (which is also very straight forward – same as before).\n\n### New look menu options\n\nThe left hand navigation bar has a new layout.\n\n### New look configuration page\n\nA new look configuration page provides a more desciption view of the Configuration options in Tagger.\n\n### Continuous Timer under main Timer\n\nThe continous timer (previously hidden) is now visible underneath the main Timer in Manager Mode.\n\n### Dark and Light Theme options\n\nTagger can now be viewed in a Light mode instead of the classic Dark mode by updating the preferences.\n\n\n## Mar 9, 2023\n\nThis update documents the following changes:\n- Ability to change button sizes\n- FIX: Adjust height on graphics for display on Tablet devices\n- FIX: Timer refactoring to prevent time lag\n\n### Ability to change button sizes\n\nUsers now have the option of changing the size of the Player and Event buttons to suit their device and configuration. This can be done in the Preferences page with the addition of 2 new dropdowns for Player Button Size and Event Button Size.\n\n### FIX: Adjust height on graphics for display on Tablet devices\n\nFor graphics with heights greater than the height of the device they are using, the graphics will now be scaled down accordingly.\n\n### FIX: Timer refactoring to prevent time lag\n\nIt was reported that on some older devices with low processing power that users noticed a lag in the Timer. The Timer functionality has now been refactored to always be synched up correctly.\n\n## Mar 7, 2023\n\nThis update documents the following changes:\n- New Teams setup functionality\n- Video Analysis mode\n- Live Manager Mode\n\n### New Teams setup functionality\n\nA new \"Teams\" page accessible from the main menu has now been added. This allows users to add one or more teams, setting default values for the team name, team colors and sport configuration as well as configuring a squad of players. When creating a new game, users can now select their default team which will populate the team name, default colors and sport config from the pre-defined team. In the team selection, users can now quickly select their team using player dropdowns from their squad.\n\n### Video Analysis mode\n\nThis is a new Tagger view which can be set in the Preferences page. It is a more optimised view for tagging video with the video player to the top left of the screen, events table underneath. On the right side of the screen will be the player and event buttons along with a prominent timer. This is currently only available on larger devices (large tablets, labtops, etc...)\n\n### Live Manager Mode\n\nManager Mode was developed in collaboration with expert coaches, managers and analysts from the world of Hockey (relevant for many other sports also). The purpose of this feature is to support Coaches and Managers in particular during live games to manage rolling substitutions and on-field positional switches, monitor cards and countdowns, track players game time, throw alerts when specialist type players like a Flicker or Trapper are not on the field of play, change formations during the game and to display Quick Totals (basic counts of things like Shots and Penalty Corners).\n\nThe Manager Mode feature was designed and optimised in particular for Tablet and larger devices (Standard mode is available for mobile devices).\n\nSee here for more details - [Tagger - Manager Mode](/blog/11-tagger-manager-mode)\n\n\n## Jan 19, 2023\n\nThis update documents the following changes:\n- New Sign Up and Subscription functionality\n- New Data Model\n- New Info Cards object for Dashboard\n- Player game Time Tracker\n- Synchronize data with video\n- Default Player Event functionality\n- XML Download\n- Edit Event Instance\n\n### New Sign Up and Subscription functionality\n\nNew sign up and sign in functionality has been added. A 60 day trial is in place after sign up. Basic subscription plan is available to subscribe to. \n\nLimited functionality in free mode (3 primary event buttons, 3 event accelerators).\n\n### New Data Model\n\nInstead of Event, Event Type and Event Outcome, we now have Event, Event Labels (multiple) and Event Links.\n\nWhat this means is that you can now add multiple descriptive items to an Event in the form of an Event Label. For example a Shot event could have a label to specify the shot was from Open Play or Free Kick and also a label to specify if the player used his right foot or left foot - this is all configurable.\n\nEvent Links essentially replace the Event Outcome. So instead of a Shot Event having an Event Outcome of Goal or Off Target, these are now separate Events that are linked together via the Event Links. And means that you can also add labels to the outcome Event if you like. The user experience should be pretty much the same as before.\n\nAlso introduced Event Accelerators. These are essentially shortcuts to tag multiple events and labels using the one button. This would mean extra buttons on the screen but less clicks when tagging.\n\nTo use the new data model, go to the Preferences screen from the left hand menu. Then at the bottom change the data model version from v1 to v2. Shortly v2 will be the only option and v1 will be removed.\n\nFor existing games, when you import these into the app, they will automatically get converted to the v2 format and you should be able to see all your charts, position maps, totals, etc... as normal. Similarly if you import an existing saved Configuration this will also get migrated to the new data model.\n\n\n### New Info Cards object for Dashboard\n\nInfo cards are a new way of displaying event info broken down by periods.\n\n### Player game Time Tracker\n\nThe player time tracker functionality tracks the total time a player is on the pitch as well as the current shift time. Also tracks the current off time for subsitutes.\n\n### Synchronize data with video\n\nAfter doing live tagging you can now add your video source and synchronize the tagged events with the video.\n\n### Default Player Event functionality\n\nThere is an option now on the Tagger page to select a \"Default\" event. When a \"Default\" event has been selected then everytime a user clicks on a Player button then that \"Default\" event instance will be created.\n\n### XML Download\n\nThere is now the ability to download the event data in XML format compatible with industry standard.\n\n### Edit Event Instance\n\nYou can now edit an event instance that was tagged, instead of having to delete and re-tag.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Dec 02, 2022\n\nThis update documents  the following changes:\n- Live tagging window\n- Game Periods configuration\n- Export event instances to Clipper file\n- Lead and Lag times configuration\n- Turn Dashboard carousal cycle off by default\n- Zone Configuration - Polygon zone shape\n- FIX: Position Map filter and search bug fixes\n- FIX: xy data not getting downloaded to csv\n- FIX: Bar charts - inconsistent results when multiple event types selected\n\n### Live tagging window\n\nIn live tagging mode (i.e. no video) the team based events will be displayed in the center of the screen. This removes a click by not having to hit the team tag button first to access the team based events. \n\n### Game Periods configuration\n\nAny number of game periods and extra time periods can now by specified. Allows greater flexibilty for different sports.\n\n### Export event instances to Clipper file\n\nIn the Events Data page there is now an option to export the event instances to a Playlist file that can be directly imported into the Clipper app for advanced clip editing.\n\n### Lead and Lag times configuration\n\nIt is now possible to specify Lead and Lag times in the Event Configuration. When viewing clips of event instances, the video timeframe slider will be set to the lead and lag times specified in the event configuration.\nIf none set then it will use the system default lead and lag times of -10 to 5.\n\n### Turn Dashboard carousal cycle off by default\n\nPreviously the default was an automatic cycle of the carousals in the Dashboard. This is not switched off by default but can switched on again per user preference.\n\n### Zone Configuration - Polygon zone shape\n\nIt is now possible to configure 3 and 4 sided (for now) Polygon zones. \n\n### FIX: Position Map filter and search bug fixes\n\nFixed position map configuration filters. Position maps recognize event type and outcome filters set in the configuration.\nFixed player search in Dashboard Position Maps.\n\n### FIX: xy data not getting downloaded to csv\n\nIn the Events Data page the xy co-ordinates were not getting downloaded as part of the csv. This is now fixed.\n\n### FIX: Bar charts - inconsistent results when multiple event types selected\n\nThe bar charts were showing inconsistent results when multiple event types were selected.

It is important to decide what you would like to tag during a game, what you would like to understand from the tagged events and how you would like to tag the events. Recently Tagger has introduced a new event data model to allow for a simpler yet more flexible and powerful event process. \n\nPreviously (v1) the Event model was structured as follows:\n\n- Event (e.g. Shot)\n- Event Type (single attribute to describe the event e.g. From Play, From Free Kick, etc..)\n- Event Outcome (single attribute to describe the outcome of the event e.g. Goal, Off Target, etc...)\n\n<br>\n\nThe latest (v2) Event model is now structured as follows:\n\n- Event (e.g. Shot)\n- Event Labels (multiple attributes to describe the event, e.g. a label to describe the Shot Type - From Play, From Free Kick, etc.., a label to describe the Body Part - Left Foot, Right Foot, etc.. )\n- Event Links (a link to another Event - this replaces the older Outcome object - now a Shot event would be \"linked\" to a Goal event)\n- Event Accelerators (shortcuts to select one or more pre-selected Events and Labels)\n\n<br>\n\nIn this blog series we will focus on the multiple ways to configure the events with the v2 event model.\n\nFor the purposes of this blog I have started with a blank canvas Football configuration.

For these new Events we will put them in their own Event Group so create a group called \"Shot Outcomes\" first and then create the events.\n\n    - For these events we will leave most fields unselected including the Primary Event field as we want these events to be \"secondary\" events that will be displayed when the Shot button is clicked.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/01-new-events.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"90%\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n- Once created it should look something like this:\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/02-new-events-created.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"90%\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n### Configure the new Event Link\n\n- The next step is to create a link between the Shot event and the newly created events for shot outcomes.\n    - In the Event configuration page -> Event Links, click the New button to create a new link.\n\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/03-new-event-link.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"90%\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n- Give the link a name e.g. \"Shot to Outcomes\". Specify Shot for the \"From Event\" and Goal, Saved and Off Target for the To Event. Leave the default value of One Way in the Link Direction field - this will be explained further later on but means that the direction of flow is currently from the Shot -> to the Goal, Saved or Off Target events. Click Save.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/04-event-link-details.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Event Link is created.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/05-event-link-created.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Now back in the Tagger page, click on the Player and then the Shot event.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/06-tagger-click-shot.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- The linked Events will now be available to select.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/07-tagger-linked-events-available.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n- Click on one of the linked events e.g. Goal, and you will then be prompted to select the Labels for the events that you have selected. Once they are selected you will select the shot position as before.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/08-tagger-linked-events-click.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- After the event is saved you will then see that 2 new events have been saved in the Events table.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/09-tagger-linked-events-saved.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- What you may notice at this stage is that there is no Player assigned to the Goal event instance. Let's fix that by updating the Goal event to require a player to be selected.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/10-events-specify-player.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Now we don't want to have to select the player twice when tagging the event so let's go to our Shot event and set the \"Keep Player Active after Event Save\" so that the player selected for the Shot will also be automatically selected for the Goal.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/11-events-keep-player-active.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Now repeat the steps in the Tagger page to tag the Shot and Goal events. This time you will see that the player is assigned to both event instances.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/12-events-player-assigned-to-both.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Change the Event Link direction\n\n- Now let's change the direction of the Event Link that we created to two way - this means that we can now click on one of the outcome events Goal, Saved and Off Target and that will activate the Shot event. Now as the Event Link only has a single Event specified in the From Event then the Shot event will automatically be selected, thus saving us a click.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/13-event-link-two-way.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Before we go back to the Tagger page, let's update the Shot event to unselect \"Primary Event\" and update the Goal, Saved and Off Target events to make them Primary so that they are available upfront in the Tagger page and also select the \"Keep Player Active after Event Save\" so that the Shot event will be assigned the same player.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/14-event-change-primary.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- In the Tagger page we can now see that the outcome events are available to select. Lets click on a Player and on the Saved button.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/15-tagger-events-displayed.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Now select our labels for the events.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/16-tagger-prompted-for-labels.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n- Our events are now saved as before (with one less click!).\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-event-links/17-tagger-event-saved.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"70%\"/>\n</p>\n\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/09-tagger-event-links","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1681040947363},"$loki":8},{"slug":"10-tagger-event-accelerators","description":"The fourth in a series of blogs to describe how to configure events.

This was developed in collaboration with expert coaches, managers and analysts from the world of Hockey (relevant for many other sports also). The purpose of this feature is to support Coaches and Managers in particular during live games to manage rolling substitutions and on-field positional switches, monitor cards and countdowns, track players game time, throw alerts when specialist type players like a Flicker or Trapper are not on the field of play, change formations during the game and to display Quick Totals (basic counts of things like Shots and Penalty Corners).\n\nThe Manager Mode feature was designed and optimised in particular for Tablet and larger devices (Standard mode is available for mobile devices).\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/01-manager-mode.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n## Enable Manager Mode\n\nManager Mode can be enabled in the Application Preferences page. Select Live Manager Mode from the Tagger View options. This will default a number of other preferences further down e.g. the Live Manager Mode Display Options will default to Team Formation Portrait View and so forth.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/02-enable-manager-mode.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nThe Live Manager Mode Default Player Event dropdown will be set to \"Substitute/Switch\". What this means is that when a user clicks on a player button (from the list or the team formation) then that will trigger the substitute/switch event.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/03-preferences.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nOther options like the Player Buttons and Event Buttons will also be set. \n\nAll of these options can be changed to suit the user and their specific device.\n\n\n## Manager Mode Sport Configuration\n\nAs part of the collaboration we developed a specific \"Hockey - Manager Mode\" sport configuration - this is a smaller subset of the standard \"Hockey\" configuration. When users are creating a new game and want to use the Manager Mode, they should choose this sport configuration instead of the standard \"Hockey\" configuration.\n\n\n## Features\n\nThe core features of Manager Mode include the following:\n\n- Rolling substitutions and on-field Switches\n- Cards and countdowns\n- Track players game time \n- Throw alerts when specialist type players are not on the field of play \n- Modify the team formation before and during the game\n- Display Quick Totals\n\n\n### Substitutions and Switches\n\nSubstitutions and Switches can be performed very quickly by having the Default Player Event set to \"Substitute/Switch\" as mentioned above. This allows subsitutions and switches to be tracked seamlessly with two clicks (in the case of substitutions, the first click is the player coming off and the second click is the player coming on). In sports with rolling substitutions like Hockey then this becomes an important component on match day.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/04-subs-switches.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Cards and Countdowns\n\nTo assign a card to a player, click on the card button, then select the card color button.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/05-card-button.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"45%\"/>\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/06-card-options.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"45%\"/>\n</p>\n\nThen select the player to assign the card to:\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/07-card-player.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\nThe card is now assigned to the player and also appears in the Quick Totals section under the team. The card countdown begins. (Note: the card countdown is displayed in minutes and is refreshed every 5 secs by default).\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/08-card-assigned.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Track players game time\n\nThe players game time is linked to the main Timer so will pause and restart along with the Timer. It shows the players current shift time (or offshift time if one of the subs) and the total playing time for the player. This is a crucial component in aiding managers and coaches in their decision making when making substitutions.\n\nThe players game time is refreshed every 5 secs by default.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/09-player-game-time.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Specialist Role Alerts\n\nIn Hockey like many other sports there are players on the team who have \"Specialist\" skills/roles. In Hockey, examples of these skills/roles could be the Flicker, Trapper and Injector roles. When a substitution happens, the app will notify the manager/coach via an alert if there are no players on the field with the specialist roles.\n\nSpecialist roles can be defined in the Configuration. And the roles can be assigned to players in the Game Details.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/10-specialist-role-alerts.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Team Formation\n\nThe team formation component is useful to visualise the teams current formation and the player positions. The team formation can be modified at any time before or during the game to reflect the managers/coaches changes.\n\nTo modify the team formation, click on the Edit button. Then drag the players into their new formation - then hit save, optionally enter a description of the formation change.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/11-team-formation-changes.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Quick Totals\n\nThe quick totals section displays a summary of some of the key events that a manager or coach may want to track such as Shots or Penalty Corners.\n\n<br>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/images/blog/tagger-manager-mode/12-quick-totals.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"80%\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nManager Mode is the result of weeks of collaboration with coaches, managers and analysts to come up with an optimised tagging view for assisting with live game management from a manager/coach perspective. Hockey was the main sport that this collaboration was focused on, however it can be used and could prove useful across any number of sports.\n\nThank you to all who participated in this collaboration (particularly Jimmy Culnane of Wimbledon and England Hockey) to bring this feature to fruition!","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/11-tagger-manager-mode","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1681040947400},"$loki":10},{"slug":"12-faq","description":"Tagger - Frequently Asked Questions","title":"Tagger - FAQs","image":"/images/welcome/charts.png","publishedAt":"2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"name":"Teamoppy Sports","avatarUrl":"/tsavatar.svg","link":"https://twitter.com/teamoppy"},"tags":["Performance Analysis","Sport","FAQ"],"toc":[{"id":"why-doesnt-manager-mode-work-when-my-tablet-is-in-portrait-mode","depth":2,"text":"Why doesn't Manager Mode work when my tablet is in Portrait mode?"},{"id":"i-am-in-manager-mode-but-clicking-on-players-is-not-triggering-substitution-what-is-happening","depth":2,"text":"I am in Manager Mode but clicking on players is not triggering substitution.

When the tablet is in Portrait mode then the layout defaults to the Standard Tagger layout. It can be confusing during a game if the layout automatically changes due to a tablet rotation so it is recommended to lock your screen in Landscape mode while using Tagger. Instructions for iPad and Samsung tablets below. Check your specific device documentation for instructions.\n\n[iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/guide/ipad/ipad997da805/ipados)\n\n[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00088202/)\n\n## I am in Manager Mode but clicking on players is not triggering substitution. What is happening?\n\nCheck the Preferences page. The Live Manager Mode - Default Player Event needs to be set to Substitute/Switch for substitution to automatically be triggered when clicking on a player.\n\n## In Manager Mode I see 2 times displayed in the Timer. What is the 2nd time?\n\nThe main larger timer pauses and plays when the pause/play button is pressed. The second smaller timer is a continuous time that only stops when you end a period or end the game. The continuous time is what is used when synching up video with your live game data post game.\n\n## How do I save a game?\n\nFrom the Game dropdown menu in Tagger, select the Download option. This downloads the game to your local device where you can then store in your own file system.\n\nPlease note that the Download XML option is for when you want to use the game in any other analysis platform that is compatible with the XML format.\n\n## How do I re-open a saved game?\n\nFrom the Game dropdown menu in Tagger, select the Import option. Choose your game file from your local file system and Import.\n\n## I created a Team on my laptop but I don't see it on my tablet?\n\nData is local to the device that it is on. You can download your Team and send it to yourself via email and import it into your other devices.\n\nThis also applies to all other data objects such as Games and Sport Configurations.\n\n## The buttons on my Tagger screen are too large or too small. How do I adjust them?\n\nThere are a number of options that you can select on the Preferences page to adjust the layout and the button sizes as well as change to using Short names or Icons. There are many different devices out there so playing around with these options are the best way to get the best view on your device.\n\n## What is the best way of sharing the game with others?\n\nThere are a couple of options for Sharing the game - these are outlined on the Share page in the Tagger app. You can either download the file and send by email or otherwise to other people. Or you can upload to Google Drive and create a direct Tagger link using the Google Drive shared link. The direct Tagger link is a popular way of sharing data.\n\n## How do I Sign up to Tagger?\n\nClick the Sign In button on the top right of the screen. Then click the Sign Up Now link to sign up to TeamOppy Tagger.\n\n## I am signed up and my trial period has ended. How do I subscribe?\n\nClick on your email at the top right of the screen to go to your profile.

It can be used for live game tagging or for post game video tagging. Tagger accelerates the event tagging and analysis process.\n\nYou can be up and running within seconds of launching the application. Just create a New Game, fill in your team details, choose your sport (or create your own one), start the timer and begin tagging.\n\n## Tagging Engine\n\nThe tagging engine allows you to tag by player or by team. Simply click on the player button or the team tag button to open the event window. Click on the event along with the event labels. Select the event positions and/or outcome positions where applicable to gather x,y data. The event is captured and added to the events table. The Dashboard will be automatically updated.\n\n## Live or Video Tagging\n\nTagger can be used for live game tagging (i.e. no video) or post game video tagging. For video tagging simply add your video source in the game details (YouTube url, Vimeo url or Local File), use the video controls to go to the start of the game, pause the video and set your Timer to be in sync with the video. The timer will then tick along with the video and pause with the video etc...\n\nWhen events are tagged, then the video time of the event will also be tracked allowing you to view a clip of each event that is tagged in the Event Viewer. You can open the event viewer from various places - in the events table, position maps, etc...\n\n## Dashboard\n\nTagger has a built in Dashboard which is customisable and displays a number of items which give a 360 degree view of the game:\n- Summary totals including the score.\n- Timeline, Bar, Pie and Donut Charts.\n- Position Maps showing x, y positions for events.\n- Insights into passages of play focusing on outcomes.\n\n## Player Tables\n\nYou can get more granular into the the data by viewing the Player Tables to see totals per individual player. This is customisable - you can add new columns to existing tables or create brand new tables.\n\n## Customise\n\nPretty much everything in Tagger is customisable. Go to the Configuration page to configure everything including:\n- General details such as number of players per team, number of minutes per half\n- Playing Area Graphics\n- Playing Area Zones\n- Events\n- Scores\n- Totals\n- Timeline Graphs\n- Charts\n- Position Maps\n- Player Tables\n- Passages of play\n\n## Share\n\nTagger generates a JSON (data) file with game and configuration data.

Tagger provides a number of system defined Sport configurations but these should be used as examples and each analyst should customise their configuration according to their needs.\n\nIn the Event Configuration tab there are a number of configurable items - Events, Event Groups, Event Labels, Event Links and Event Accelerators.\n\n### Blogs\n\nLearn more about Events in our tutorials here:\n- [Configure Events](https://www.teamoppy.com/blog/07-tagger-events) \n- [Configure Event Labels](https://www.teamoppy.com/blog/08-tagger-event-labels) \n- [Configure Event Links](https://www.teamoppy.com/blog/09-tagger-event-links) \n- [Configure Event Accelerators](https://www.teamoppy.com/blog/10-tagger-event-accelerators) \n\n### Events\n\nWhen you tag an event in the Tagger page you are tagging an instance of an Event Configuration. Events will behave differently based on the options selected in the configuration.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Name\n\nEach event requires a name. This is the default display text on the Event buttons in the Tagger page (however this can be changed in the Preferences to use short name or an icon).\n\n#### Event Group\n\nEach event should be assigned to an Event Group. The button will be displayed in the Event Group container in the Tagger page.\n\n#### Enabled\n\nThe event needs to be enabled to be used in the Tagger page.\n\n#### Primary Event\n\nSelect this switch to display this as a primary button in the Tagger page. A primary button is displayed in the Tagger page without any preselections. Typically if this is switched off then the event would be part of an Event Link that would require another event to activate it.\n\n#### Color\n\nThis is the color for the Event button.\n\n#### Text Color (white)\n\nThis controls the text shown in the Event button. Either black or white text.\n\n#### Icon\n\nThis is the Events icon. Users can switch to display the event icon in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices. Icons can be chosen from the https://materialdesignicons.com/ site.\n\n#### Short Name\n\nThis is a shortened version of the Event name. Users can switch to display the event short name in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices.\n\n#### Event Labels\n\nThis is a list of Event Labels that are selectable in the Tagger page. Labels are used to provide additional descriptions to the Event. For example a Shot event may have a label for Shot Type (From Open Play, From Free Kick, etc....) and a label for Body Part (Left Foot, Right Foot, Head, etc...)\n\n#### Event Team\n\nThe Event Team would often be left unselected in the Configuration - the event instance would default the team to the team where the button is displayed. In some cases though you may want to define a button that will always set the Event instance team to Team A or Team B. Other options in this dropdown include \"Same\" which will always set the team to the team where the button is displayed and also \"Opposite\" which will always set the team to the opposite team from where the button is displayed.\n\n#### Specify Player for event\n\nWhen this is selected then a player button needs to be selected before the Event will be selectable in the Tagger page.\n\n#### Keep Player Active after Event Save\n\nWhen this is selected then the player will remain active (selected) after the Event instance has been saved. For example, for the \"Pass Received\" event you may want to keep the player active as that player will most likely trigger the next event. This helps to reduce the clicks when tagging.\n\n#### Specify Position for Event\n\nIf you want to specify x, y positions for the event then select this checkbox.\n\n#### Events Playing Area\n\nSelect the Playing Area that the co-ordinates should be selected on.\n\n#### Specify count for Tag\n\nIf this option is selected then it allows the user to enter a count of the Event when they occurred. For example when live tagging you may want to count the number of passes in a sequence and just click the \"Passing\" button and enter a count of passes.\n\n#### Lead Time\n\nLead Time is used to allow a lead time for an event when displaying the video clip of the event, i.e. the clip will start a number of seconds before the time of the event instance.\n\n#### Lag Time\n\nLag Time is used to allow a lag time for an event when displaying the video clip of the event, i.e. the clip will end a number of seconds after the time of the event instance.\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n### Event Groups\n\nConfigure your Event Groups. Event Groups form categories for your event buttons and help to control the display in the Tagger page.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Name\n\nThe Event Group name.\n\n#### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable this group in the Tagger page.\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n### Event Labels\n\nConfigure your Event Label definitions here. Event Labels are used to add additional descriptions to Events. You can add an Event Label to one or more Events.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Name\n\nThe Event Label name e.g. in the context of a \"Shot\" event you could create a label called \"Body Part\".\n\n#### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable this label.\n\n#### Label Options\n\nEach label can have a number of label options. These are what is actually selected at runtime in the Tagger page. e.g. for a label called \"Body Part\", you could have label options for \"Right foot\", \"Left foot\" or \"Head\". You would select one of these options when tagging an event instance.\n\n<ul>\n\n##### Name\n\nThe name of the label option\n\n##### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the label option\n\n##### Color\n\nThe color of the label option button.\n\n##### Text Color (white)\n\nThis controls the text shown in the Label Option button. Either black or white text.\n\n##### Icon\n\nThis is the Label Option icon. Users can switch to display the event icon in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices. Icons can be chosen from the https://materialdesignicons.com/ site.\n\n##### Short Name\n\nThis is a shortened version of the Label Option name. Users can switch to display the label option short name in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices.\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n### Event Links\n\nDefine links to automatically activate or select other events when a particular event is selected. e.g. a \"Shot\" event could have a link to a \"Goal\" event and a \"Wide\" event.\n\nWhat do we mean by activate? We mean that when the \"Shot\" button is clicked, then the \"Goal\" and \"Wide\" event buttons will appear and be selectable.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Name\n\nThe name of the link\n\n#### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the link\n\n#### From Event\n\nSelect the event from which the link will originate from e.g. \"Shot\" event\n\n#### Link Direction\n\nLink direction determines the direction of the link activation. If \"One Way\" is selected the activation can only happen in one direction i.e. From Event => To Event. \"Two Way\" means that it is bi-directional.\n\n#### To Event\n\nSelect the event to which the link will activate e.g. \"Goal\" or \"Wide\" event\n\n</ul>\n\n### Event Accelerators\n\nEvent Accelerators can help to speed up the tagging process by automatically selecting Events and Labels with a one button click.\n\n#### Name\n\nThe name of the Accelerator. This is displayed in the Tagger window.\n\n#### Event Group\n\nThe Event Group that the Accelerator will be displayed in.\n\n#### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the Accelerator.\n\n#### Event Selections\n\nChoose one or more Events to automatically select. The order of the Event Selections is important as this is how they will be added to the events table.\n\n<ul>\n\n##### Event Selection\n\nThe event to select.\n\n##### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the Event Selection.\n\n##### Labels\n\nThe event labels to automatically select.\n\n<ul>\n\n###### Event Label\n\nEvent Label\n\n###### Event Label Option\n\nEvent label option to automatically select for the Accelerator\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>","dir":"/docs/tagger","path":"/docs/tagger/08-event-configuration","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-09T11:48:09.038Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1681040947552},"$loki":22},{"slug":"09-score-configuration","description":"Configure Score","title":"Score Configuration","toc":[{"id":"scores","depth":2,"text":"Scores"},{"id":"event-score-configuration","depth":2,"text":"Event Score Configuration"},{"id":"name","depth":3,"text":"Name"},{"id":"value","depth":3,"text":"Value"},{"id":"event","depth":3,"text":"Event"},{"id":"event-label-option-filters","depth":3,"text":"Event Label Option Filters"},{"id":"linked-event-score-configuration","depth":2,"text":"Linked Event Score Configuration"},{"id":"name-1","depth":3,"text":"Name"},{"id":"value-1","depth":3,"text":"Value"},{"id":"event-link","depth":3,"text":"Event Link"},{"id":"linked-from-event","depth":3,"text":"Linked From Event"},{"id":"linked-from-event-label-option-filters","depth":3,"text":"Linked From Event Label Option Filters"},{"id":"linked-to-event","depth":3,"text":"Linked To Event"},{"id":"score-display-format","depth":2,"text":"Score Display Format"},{"id":"type","depth":3,"text":"Type"},{"id":"definition","depth":3,"text":"Definition"},{"id":"text","depth":3,"text":"Text"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"scores"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#scores","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Scores"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Configure scores for your sport.

Currently you can create Pie, Donut and Bar charts in this chart configuration.\n\n<ul> \nNote: Timeline Graphs are configured separately.\n</ul>\n\n### Chart Configuration\n\n<ul>\n\n### Name\n\nThe name of the chart\n\n### Enabled\n\nSet this to enable the chart. Controls if it is to be displayed in the Dashboard.\n\n### Chart Type\n\nThe type of chart - Pie, Donut or Bar.\n\n\n### Pie/Donut Chart Breakdown Type\n\nThe breakdown of the Chart visualisation. Can be By Team, By Event Label, By Linked To Event. \n- By Team - shows the chart with breakdown of the event data per team.\n- By Event Label - shows the chart with breakdown of the event data by a label - See additional breakdown selections once the event filter has been selected.\n- By Linked To Event - shows the chart with breakdown of the event data by the linked to events. For example if Shot is specified for the Event, then you could specify \"By Linked To Event\" and specify Goal and Off Target. The chart will show the breakdown of the Shots by their Linked To Events (\"outcome\" event).\n\n### Bar Chart Breakdown Type\n\nThe breakdown of the bar chart. This can be By Period, By Event Player, By To Event Player. \n- By Period will show a horizontal chart with columns broken down into the time periods/halfs of the game.\n- By Event Player will show a vertical chart with stacked columns per player for the Event Player.\n- By To Event Player will show a vertical chart with stacked columns per player for the Linked To Event Player.\n\n\n### Event Filters\n\nThe filters to apply to the data that the chart is based on.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Event Team\n\nThe event team.\n\n#### Event\n\nThe event.\n\n#### Event Label Option Filter\n\nThe event labels.\n\n#### Event Zone(s)\n\nSet a filter for the event zone(s).\n\n#### Event Link\n\nIf the chart is based on a linked event then select the link.\n\n#### Linked To Event Team\n\nSet the linked to event team.\n\n#### Linked To Events\n\nSelect the linked to events\n\n#### Linked To Event Zone(s)\n\nSet a filter on the linked to event zones.\n\n</ul>\n\n### Pie/Donut Chart Breakdown - select label and options\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Breakdown Event Label\n\nSelect the label that the chart breakdown is based on.\n\n#### Breakdown Event Label Option\n\nSelect the label options that the chart breakdown is based
