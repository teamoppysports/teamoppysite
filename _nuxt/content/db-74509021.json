A 60 day trial is in place after sign up. Basic subscription plan is available to subscribe to. Limited functionality in free mode.\n\n### New Data Model\n\nInstead of Event, Event Type and Event Outcome, we now have Event, Event Labels (multiple) and Event Links.\n\nWhat this means is that you can now add multiple descriptive items to an Event in the form of an Event Label. For example a Shot event could have a label to specify the shot was from Open Play or Free Kick and also a label to specify if the player used his right foot or left foot - this is all configurable.\n\nEvent Links essentially replace the Event Outcome. So instead of a Shot Event having an Event Outcome of Goal or Off Target, these are now separate Events that are linked together via the Event Links. And means that you can also add labels to the outcome Event if you like. The user experience should be pretty much the same as before.\n\nAlso introduced Event Accelerators. These are essentially shortcuts to tag multiple events and labels using the one button. This would mean extra buttons on the screen but less clicks when tagging.\n\nTo use the new data model, go to the Preferences screen from the left hand menu. Then at the bottom change the data model version from v1 to v2. Shortly v2 will be the only option and v1 will be removed.\n\nFor existing games, when you import these into the app, they will automatically get converted to the v2 format and you should be able to see all your charts, position maps, totals, etc... as normal. Similarly if you import an existing saved Configuration this will also get migrated to the new data model.\n\n\n### New Info Cards object for Dashboard\n\nInfo cards are a new way of displaying event info broken down by periods.\n\n### Player game Time Tracker\n\nThe player time tracker functionality tracks the total time a player is on the pitch as well as the current shift time. Also tracks the current off time for subsitutes.\n\n### Synchronize data with video\n\nAfter doing live tagging you can now add your video source and synchronize the tagged events with the video.\n\n### Default Player Event functionality\n\nThere is an option now on the Tagger page to select a \"Default\" event. When a \"Default\" event has been selected then everytime a user clicks on a Player button then that \"Default\" event instance will be created.\n\n### XML Download\n\nThere is now the ability to download the event data in XML format compatible with industry standard.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Dec 02, 2022\n\nThis update documents  the following changes:\n- Live tagging window\n- Game Periods configuration\n- Export event instances to Clipper file\n- Lead and Lag times configuration\n- Turn Dashboard carousal cycle off by default\n- Zone Configuration - Polygon zone shape\n- FIX: Position Map filter and search bug fixes\n- FIX: xy data not getting downloaded to csv\n- FIX: Bar charts - inconsistent results when multiple event types selected\n\n### Live tagging window\n\nIn live tagging mode (i.e. no video) the team based events will be displayed in the center of the screen. This removes a click by not having to hit the team tag button first to access the team based events. \n\n### Game Periods configuration\n\nAny number of game periods and extra time periods can now by specified. Allows greater flexibilty for different sports.\n\n### Export event instances to Clipper file\n\nIn the Events Data page there is now an option to export the event instances to a Playlist file that can be directly imported into the Clipper app for advanced clip editing.\n\n### Lead and Lag times configuration\n\nIt is now possible to specify Lead and Lag times in the Event Configuration. When viewing clips of event instances, the video timeframe slider will be set to the lead and lag times specified in the event configuration.\nIf none set then it will use the system default lead and lag times of -10 to 5.\n\n### Turn Dashboard carousal cycle off by default\n\nPreviously the default was an automatic cycle of the carousals in the Dashboard. This is not switched off by default but can switched on again per user preference.\n\n### Zone Configuration - Polygon zone shape\n\nIt is now possible to configure 3 and 4 sided (for now) Polygon zones. \n\n### FIX: Position Map filter and search bug fixes\n\nFixed position map configuration filters. Position maps recognize event type and outcome filters set in the configuration.\nFixed player search in Dashboard Position Maps.\n\n### FIX: xy data not getting downloaded to csv\n\nIn the Events Data page the xy co-ordinates were not getting downloaded as part of the csv. This is now fixed.\n\n### FIX: Bar charts - inconsistent results when multiple event types selected\n\nThe bar charts were showing inconsistent results when multiple event types were selected. This is now fixed.","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/tagger-release-notes","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-01-19T17:31:30.581Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T17:31:30.581Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1674149541978},"$loki":3},{"slug":"tagger","description":"Tagger is an Event Tagging application with a built in Dashboard.

It can be used for live game tagging or for post game video tagging. Tagger accelerates the event tagging and analysis process.\n\nYou can be up and running within seconds of launching the application. Just create a New Game, fill in your team details, choose your sport (or create your own one), start the timer and begin tagging.\n\n## Tagging Engine\n\nThe tagging engine allows you to tag by player or by team. Simply click on the player button or the team tag button to open the event window. Click on the event along with the event type and event outcome if applicable. Select the event positions and/or outcome positions where applicable to gather x,y data. The event is captured and added to the event table. The Dashboard will be automatically updated.\n\n## Live or Video Tagging\n\nTagger can be used for live game tagging (i.e. no video) or post game video tagging. For video tagging simply add your video source in the game details (YouTube url, Vimeo url or Local File), use the video controls to go to the start of the game, pause the video and set your Timer to be in sync with the video. The timer will then tick along with the video and pause with the video etc...\n\nWhen events are tagged, then the video time of the event will also be tracked allowing you to view a clip of each event that is tagged in the Event Viewer. You can open the event viewer from various places - in the events table, position maps, etc...\n\n## Dashboard\n\nTagger has a built in Dashboard which is customisable and displays a number of items which give a picture of the game:\n- Summary totals including the score.\n- Timeline, Bar, Pie and Donut Charts.\n- Position Maps showing x, y positions for events.\n- Insights into passages of play focusing on outcomes.\n\n## Player Tables\n\nYou can get more granular into the the data by viewing the Player Tables to see totals per individual player. This is customisable - you can add new columns to existing tables or create brand new tables.\n\n## Customise\n\nPretty much everything in Tagger is customisable. Go to the Configuration page to configure everything including:\n- General details such as number of players per team, number of minutes per half\n- Playing Area Graphics\n- Playing Area Zones\n- Events\n- Scores\n- Totals\n- Timeline Graphs\n- Charts\n- Position Maps\n- Player Tables\n- Passages of play\n\n## Share\n\nTagger generates a JSON (data) file with game and configuration data. This can be easily shared by sending directly to team members who can import into the app or it can be shared by generating a direct link to the JSON file on Google Drive.\n\n### Example\n\n\n[Kilkenny versus Limerick - 2022 All-Ireland Hurling Final](https://tagger.teamoppy.com/?game=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1evoA6USB3yfmxu6X4lqBPoA6pB2zx3gJ%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing) is a simple example of tagging Shots, Puckouts and Possessions.\n\n\n## Progressive Web Application\n\nA progressive web application (PWA), commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform with a standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices.\n\n### Installable\n\nTagger is installable which means it can run in a standalone window instead of a browser tab. It's launchable from the user's home screen, dock, taskbar, or shelf. It's possible to search for them on a device and jump between them with the app switcher, making them feel like part of the device they're installed on.\n\n### Offline mode\n\nTagger can run in offline mode (i.e. no internet connection) or online mode.\n\n## Thanks\n\nA word of thanks to all the volunteers who helped to test Tagger, providing very positive feedback and also making some really good suggestions for new features which will be worked on in the coming months.\n\n## Get Started\n\nClick here to get started - [Tagger](https://tagger.teamoppy.com)","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/tagger","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-01-19T17:31:30.581Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T17:31:30.581Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1674149541997},"$loki":4},{"slug":"welcome","description":"Welcome to TeamOppy Sports - Performance Analysis software.","title":"Welcome to TeamOppy Sports","image":"/images/welcome/charts.png","publishedAt":"2022-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","author":{"name":"Teamoppy Sports","avatarUrl":"/tsavatar.svg","link":"https://twitter.com/teamoppy"},"tags":["Performance Analysis","Sport","Events","Video"],"toc":[{"id":"performance-analysis","depth":2,"text":"Performance Analysis"},{"id":"teamoppy-sports","depth":2,"text":"TeamOppy Sports"},{"id":"tagger","depth":3,"text":"Tagger"},{"id":"clipper","depth":3,"text":"Clipper"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"performance-analysis"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#performance-analysis","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Performance Analysis"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Performance Analysis is an essential component in modern day team and individual sports.

If your sport does not exist then you can create your own sport by clicking on the \"+\" button beside the sport dropdown.\n\n- Optionally specify the Competition, Date and Venue.\n\n- If you want to do video tagging then specify a video source. You can choose from using a Local file that is on your device or a YouTube or Vimeo url.\n\n- Edit your team lists with the player details (number, name, short name and position).\n\n- Then click save.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Set Tagger Preferences\n\nFrom the left navigation menu, select Preferences. In here you specify how you would like the Tagger page to display the player and event buttons.\n\n- Set the Events view to either Tabs or Full. With \"Tabs\" only one teams set of events will be displayed at a time. This may be preferable on mobile devices or if you are only concerned with tagging your own teams events. With \"Full\", both teams events are displayed. This is preferable on larger devices (laptops, tablets) and when you are tagging events for both teams.\n\n- Set the Event button display to show either the name of the event, the short name of the event or the event icon. Short names and icons may be preferable for mobile devices. \n\n- Set the Player button display to show full name or short name. Short name may be preferable on mobile devices.\n\n- Set the Player button badge display. This is the little blue badge that is displayed on the player button. This can be set to display the player number or the player position, whichever is preferable.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Start the game\n\nTo start the game simply click on the Timer button near the top left of the page and press the play button.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Tag Events\n\nThe player and event buttons are enabled as soon as the timer is started and you can start tagging events by clicking on the Player and Event buttons. If an event is configured that requires a player to be selected then that event button will be disabled until a player is selected. \n\n<br/>\n\n### End a half or period\n\nTo end a half or period, click on the Timer button and click on the end period button (yellow whistle button).\n\n<br/>\n\n### Start a new half or period\n\nTo start a new half or period, click on the Timer button and click on the Play button.\n\n<br/>\n\n### End the game\n\nTo end the game, click on the Timer button and click on the Full time button (red whistle button)\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\n## Configuration\n----------------\n\n<br/>\nPretty much everything in Tagger is configurable. From events to playing area graphics, to charts and totals, etc...\n\nAt the core of everything is the Event.\n\n<br/>\n\n### Event Configuration\n\nConfiguring your event definitions is a vital part of the process within Tagger. Tagger provides a number of system defined Sport configurations but these should be used as examples and each analyst should customise their configuration according to their needs.\n\nIn the Event Configuration tab there are a number of configurable items - Events, Event Groups, Event Labels, Event Links and Event Accelerators.\n\n\n#### Events\n\nWhen you tag an event in the Tagger page you are tagging an instance of an Event Configuration. Events will behave differently based on the options selected in the configuration.\n\n<ul>\n\n##### Name\n\nEach event requires a name. This is the default display text on the Event buttons in the Tagger page (however this can be changed in the Preferences to use short name or an icon).\n\n##### Event Group\n\nEach event should be assigned to an Event Group. The button will be displayed in the Event Group container in the Tagger page.\n\n##### Enabled\n\nThe event needs to be enabled to be used in the Tagger page.\n\n##### Primary Event\n\nSelect this switch to display this as a primary button in the Tagger page. A primary button is displayed in the Tagger page without any preselections. Typically if this is switched off then the event would be part of an Event Link that would require another event to activate it.\n\n##### Color\n\nThis is the color for the Event button.\n\n##### Text Color (white)\n\nThis controls the text shown in the Event button. Either black or white text.\n\n##### Icon\n\nThis is the Events icon. Users can switch to display the event icon in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices. Icons can be chosen from the https://materialdesignicons.com/ site.\n\n##### Short Name\n\nThis is a shortened version of the Event name. Users can switch to display the event short name in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices.\n\n##### Event Labels\n\nThis is a list of Event Labels that are selectable in the Tagger page. Labels are used to provide additional descriptions to the Event. For example a Shot event may have a label for Shot Type (From Open Play, From Free Kick, etc....) and a label for Body Part (Left Foot, Right Foot, Head, etc...)\n\n##### Event Team\n\nThe Event Team would often be left unselected in the Configuration - the event instance would default the team to the team where the button is displayed. In some cases though you may want to define a button that will always set the Event instance team to Team A or Team B. Other options in this dropdown include \"Same\" which will always set the team to the team where the button is displayed and also \"Opposite\" which will always set the team to the opposite team from where the button is displayed.\n\n##### Specify Player for event\n\nWhen this is selected then a player button needs to be selected before the Event will be selectable in the Tagger page.\n\n##### Keep Player Active after Event Save\n\nWhen this is selected then the player will remain active (selected) after the Event instance has been saved. For example, for the \"Pass Received\" event you may want to keep the player active as that player will most likely trigger the next event. This helps to reduce the clicks when tagging.\n\n##### Specify Position for Event\n\nIf you want to specify x, y positions for the event then select this checkbox.\n\n##### Events Playing Area\n\nSelect the Playing Area that the co-ordinates should be selected on.\n\n##### Specify count for Tag\n\nIf this option is selected then it allows the user to enter a count of the Event when they occurred. For example when live tagging you may want to count the number of passes in a sequence and just click the \"Passing\" button and enter a count of passes.\n\n##### Lead Time\n\nLead Time is used to allow a lead time for an event when displaying the video clip of the event, i.e. the clip will start a number of seconds before the time of the event instance.\n\n##### Lag Time\n\nLag Time is used to allow a lag time for an event when displaying the video clip of the event, i.e. the clip will end a number of seconds after the time of the event instance.\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Event Groups\n\nConfigure your Event Groups. Event Groups form categories for your event buttons and help to control the display in the Tagger page.\n\n<ul>\n\n##### Name\n\nThe Event Group name.\n\n##### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable this group in the Tagger page.\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Event Labels\n\nConfigure your Event Label definitions here. Event Labels are used to add additional descriptions to Events. You can add an Event Label to one or more Events.\n\n<ul>\n\n##### Name\n\nThe Event Label name e.g. in the context of a \"Shot\" event you could create a label called \"Body Part\".\n\n##### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable this label.\n\n##### Label Options\n\nEach label can have a number of label options. These are what is actually selected at runtime in the Tagger page. e.g. for a label called \"Body Part\", you could have label options for \"Right foot\", \"Left foot\" or \"Head\". You would select one of these options when tagging an event instance.\n\n<ul>\n\n###### Name\n\nThe name of the label option\n\n###### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the label option\n\n###### Color\n\nThe color of the label option button.\n\n###### Text Color (white)\n\nThis controls the text shown in the Label Option button. Either black or white text.\n\n###### Icon\n\nThis is the Label Option icon. Users can switch to display the event icon in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices. Icons can be chosen from the https://materialdesignicons.com/ site.\n\n###### Short Name\n\nThis is a shortened version of the Label Option name. Users can switch to display the label option short name in the Preferences page. Typically used on mobile devices.\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br/>\n\n##### Event Links\n\nDefine links to automatically activate or select other events when a particular event is selected. e.g. a \"Shot\" event could have a link to a \"Goal\" event and a \"Wide\" event.\n\nWhat do we mean by activate? We mean that when the \"Shot\" button is clicked, then the \"Goal\" and \"Wide\" event buttons will appear and be selectable.\n\n<ul>\n\n###### Name\n\nThe name of the link\n\n###### Enabled\n\nSelect to enable the link\n\n###### From Event\n\nSelect the event from which the link will originate from e.g. \"Shot\" event\n\n###### Link Direction\n\nLink direction determines the direction of the link activation. If \"One Way\" is selected the activation can only happen in one direction i.e. From Event => To Event. \"Two Way\" means that it is bi-directional.\n\n###### To Event\n\nSelect the event to which the link will activate e.g. \"Goal\" or \"Wide\" event\n\n</ul>\n\n### General Configuration\n\nIn this tab you can specify general settings for the sport e.g. number of players per team, number of periods and number of minutes per period.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Number of players per team\n\nSpecifies the number of players on the team.\n\n#### Number of substitutes per team\n\nSpecifies the number of substitutes on the team.\n\n#### Number of periods per game\n\nSpecifies the number of periods/halfs.\n\n#### Number of minutes per period\n\nSpecifies the number of minutes per period.\n\n#### Number of periods of extra time per game\n\nSpecifies the number of periods/halfs of extra time.\n\n#### Number of minutes per period of extra time\n\nSpecifies the number of minutes per period of extra time.\n\n#### Enable Player Game Time Tracker\n\nEnables the the Player Game Time Tracker functionality. This tracks the total minutes played by a player in the game along with the current shift time of the player. This can be very useful in sports where roll on/off substitutions are common.\n\nNote: the below options are only visible when the Player Game Time Tracker is enabled.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Track Opposition Game Time\n\nTypically you may just want to track your own teams playing time. Set this option if you would like to track the opposition also.\n\n#### Show substitutes in the Tagger player list\n\nSelecting this option shows the substitutes in the Tagger page also. This is beneficial to see how the total minutes played by substitutes and also to show their total \"off shift\" time.\n\n#### Include total time with shift/offshift time in player list\n\nIn the Tagger page window you can choose to show the just the Shift time or include the Total time also. Select this option to include the Total time.\n\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n### Playing Areas Configuration\n\nConfigure the playing area graphics for your sport. This could be a pitch, a court, a graphic of goal posts, anything that you would like to track positions for.\n\n#### Create new playing area\n\nClick on the \"New Playing Area\" button to create a new playing area.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Playing Area Name\n\nSpecify a name for the playing area.\n\n#### Display team end indicators\n\nSwitch this on if you would like to display team end indicators. This is helpful to indicate for example the teams goals at either end of the pitch.\n\n#### Rotate in mobile device portrait mode\n\nPlaying graphics will by default display as per how they are configured. Select this to rotate the graphic when in portrait mode on a mobile device. This would be commonly used for pitch or court graphics. For goal post graphics it is likely you would leave this unselected.\n\n#### Perimeter Type\n\nCurrently the only option for perimeter type is Rectangle. More options may be added in the future.\n\n#### Perimeter Width\n\nThe width of the perimeter as viewed in landscape mode. Tip: you may want to have this a few meters wider than the actual pitch width itself.\n\n#### Perimeter Height\n\nThe height of the perimeter as viewed in landscape mode. Tip: you may want to have this a few meters wider than the actual pitch height itself.\n\n#### Perimeter Line Color\n\nThe color of the perimeter line. Can be transparent also.\n\n#### Perimeter Fill Color\n\nThe background color of the perimeter. Can be transparent also.\n\n#### Playing Area Objects\n\nThese are the lines, circles, etc... that you can draw on the graphic.\n\n<ul>\n\n#### Name\n\nGive the object a name - this should be descriptive to identify the object. Important when a graphic has many objects.\n\n#### Type\n\nThe type of object - line, rectangle, circle and ellipse.\n\n#### Line fields\n\n<ul>\n\n#### From x co-ordinate \n\nThe starting x co-ordinate for the line\n\n#### From y co-ordinate\n\nThe starting y co-ordinate for the line\n\n#### To x co-ordinate\n\nThe ending x co-ordinate for the line\n\n#### To y co-ordinate\n\nThe ending y co-ordinate for the line\n\n#### Dash Length\n\nSet this to add a dash to the line.\n\n#### Dash Gap\n\nSet this to add a dash gap to the line.\n\n</ul>\n\n#### Rectangle Fields\n\n<ul>\n\n#### X co-ordinate\n\nThe starting x co-ordinate for the rectangle (top left of rectangle).\n\n#### Y co-ordinate\n\nThe starting x co-ordinate for the rectangle (top left of rectangle).\n\n#### Width\n\nThe width of the rectangle.\n\n#### Height\n\nThe height of the rectangle.\n\n</ul>\n\n#### Circle Fields\n\n<ul>\n\n#### X co-ordinate\n\nThe x co-ordinate for the center point of the circle\n\n#### Y co-ordinate\n\nThe y co-ordinate for the center point of the circle\n\n#### Radius\n\nThe radius of the circle\n\n#### Dash Length\n\nSet this to add a dash to the circle.\n\n#### Dash Gap\n\nSet this to add a dash gap to the circle.\n\n\n</ul>\n\n#### Ellipse Fields\n\n<ul>\n\n#### X co-ordinate\n\nThe x co-ordinate for the center point of the ellipse\n\n#### Y co-ordinate\n\nThe y co-ordinate for the center point of the ellipse\n\n#### Radius X\n\nThe horizontal radius of the ellipse\n\n#### Radius Y\n\nThe vertical radius of the ellipse\n\n</ul>\n\n#### Line Color\n\nThe line color of the object.\n\n#### Fill Color\n\nThe background fill color of the object\n\n#### Clip\n\nSelect this to clip the object. This is useful if you only want to show a portion of the object that you have drawn. This would be used for example to draw a semi-circle i.e. draw a circle first and the clip it to get the resultant semi-circle.
